# Network-Computing-Service

## Introduction
This project implements a simple concurrent services--a network computing server program. The server can receive calculation requests from multiple clients at the same time, then complete the actual calculation according to the operation type and request parameters. Finally it returns the operation results to the clients.
## Purpose
1. Practice multithreaded programming by Java
2. Practice programming for network concurrent services
3. Learn how to synchronize and collaborate between multiple threads
4. Understand what is the thread safe
